# ADMR
We used a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to evaluate 1,037 risk factors/medical conditions and 31 drugs with the risk of late-onset Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD). MR estimates the unbiased causal association between an exposure and a health outcome by using genetic variants, typically in the form of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as instruments. MR found robust evidence of causal associations between glioma, trunk fat-free and AD. Our study also confirms that higher educational attainment and higher intelligence are associated with a reduced risk of AD.
